# Java-Kotlin-Interop

Kotlin documentation states that Java is **100% interoperable** with Kotlin. But there are certain cases where it does not work directly out of the box. So, this percentage can be reduced to **99.9%**

While talking about interoperability, there are two scenarios:
1. Calling Kotlin from Java
2. Calling Java from Kotlin

This project aims at demonstrating how to deal with some of the edge cases in the above scenarios.
